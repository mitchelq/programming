## Overview
Both useMemo and useCallback are React hooks used for performance optimization, but they serve different purposes. This note compares the two hooks to help you decide when to use each one.

## Key Differences

| Aspect | useMemo | useCallback |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Purpose | Memoizes a computed value | Memoizes a function |
| Returns | The result of the function | The function itself |
| Use Case | Expensive calculations | Callback functions |

## When to Use Each

### Use useMemo when:
1. You have expensive computations that don't need to run on every render
2. You want to memoize a value to pass to child components
3. You need to memoize a value for use in other hooks' dependency arrays

### Use useCallback when:
1. You're passing callback functions to optimized child components
2. You need to maintain function reference equality for hooks' dependency arrays
3. You're working with custom hooks that accept functions as arguments

## Comparative Examples

### Scenario 1: Expensive Computation

```jsx
// Using useMemo for expensive computation
const expensiveResult = useMemo(() => {
  return performExpensiveCalculation(a, b);
}, [a, b]);

// Incorrect use of useCallback for the same purpose
const expensiveResultCallback = useCallback(() => {
  return performExpensiveCalculation(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
// This would still require calling the function to get the result
```

### Scenario 2: Passing Functions to Child Components

```jsx
// Using useCallback for event handlers
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log('Button clicked');
}, []);

// Incorrect use of useMemo for the same purpose
const handleClickMemo = useMemo(() => {
  return () => console.log('Button clicked');
}, []);
// This works, but it's unnecessarily complex
```

### Scenario 3: Dependency Array Stability

```jsx
// Using useMemo for object stability in useEffect
const stableObject = useMemo(() => ({ id: userId, name: userName }), [userId, userName]);

useEffect(() => {
  // Effect using stableObject
}, [stableObject]);

// Using useCallback for function stability in useEffect
const stableFunction = useCallback(() => {
  fetchData(userId, userName);
}, [userId, userName]);

useEffect(() => {
  stableFunction();
}, [stableFunction]);
```

## Key Points
- useMemo is for memoizing values, useCallback is for memoizing functions
- Both hooks help prevent unnecessary re-renders and calculations
- useMemo returns the result of a function, useCallback returns the function itself
- Use useMemo when you want to avoid re-computing expensive values
- Use useCallback when you want to maintain function reference equality

## Best Practices
- Don't overuse either hook; only apply them where performance gains are noticeable
- Always include the correct dependencies in the dependency array
- Use the React DevTools Profiler to identify performance issues before applying optimizations
- Consider using useMemo for creating objects or arrays that are used as dependencies in other hooks
- Use useCallback for event handlers passed to child components, especially if those components are memoized

## Common Pitfalls
- Using useMemo where useCallback would be more appropriate (and vice versa)
- Forgetting that useMemo returns a value, while useCallback returns a function
- Overusing these hooks on simple calculations or functions, which can lead to decreased performance
- Not including all necessary dependencies in the dependency array

## Additional Notes
While both useMemo and useCallback are powerful optimization tools, they come with their own overhead. Always measure performance before and after applying these hooks to ensure they're providing tangible benefits to your application.
