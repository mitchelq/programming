# My Obsidian Setup and Usage

## Folder Structure

I organize my Obsidian vault with the following folder structure:

1. Concepts
2. Source Material
3. Tags
4. Indexes
5. Templates
6. Notes

## Note Template

My standard note template includes:

```markdown
#### Created: {{date}}
#### Tags:


# {{Title}}

[Content goes here]
```

## Linking and Organizing

- I use the Tags folder for creating tag hub pages
- The Indexes folder contains more prominent categories and includes sections to sort linked notes
- I create links between notes using the `[[]]` syntax

## Backlinks

- I have backlinks enabled and displayed at the bottom of my notes
- To enable this:
  1. Go to Settings > Editor
  2. Scroll to the "Display" section
  3. Toggle on "Show backlinks in document"

## Content Organization

- I prefer to split larger topics into multiple linked notes rather than having very long single notes
- For coding-related content, I often create overview notes that link to more specific topic notes

## Checklists

- I use checklists for processes and best practices, like the Clean Code Commit Checklist

## Artifacts

- I don't use Mermaid diagrams in my notes

## Note Naming and Linking Conventions

- I use descriptive titles for my notes
- Links to other notes are created using the standard Obsidian `[[]]` syntax

## Plugins

- I primarily use core Obsidian features and don't rely heavily on community plugins

Remember: This setup is flexible and can be adjusted as my needs evolve or as I discover new Obsidian features that enhance my workflow.
